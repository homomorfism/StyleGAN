## StyleGAN

This is unofficial implementation of article "Learning from Multi-domain Artistic Images for Arbitrary Style Transfer",
which is accessible via [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09987.pdf).

Link to example of using pytorch-lighting (SRGAN) is [here](https://github.com/homomorfism/SRGAN_PytorchLightning.git).

We are working in dev folder, making small branches with each feature.

Please write test notebooks using ```torchsummary``` to test module before pushing to dev folder.
Also write some comments in code so that it understand each other. 

How to run script:
